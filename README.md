# Minesweeper-DSA-Project
## Introduction
This is the Team 30 FLOP Minesweeper DSA final project. Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden “mines”. Furthermore, we also build a extra mini game called whack-a-mole for relaxing purposes.

## Documentation
### How to play:
- **Left mouse**: start a game. Then based on the numbers you see, you have to figure out where the mines are and secure them with flags, and discover more numbers to find even more mines.
- **Right mouse**: mark a field with flag.
